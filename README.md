The do it yourself date picker. It makes as no assumptions how it's shown on
the page. [__See demo__](http://tristen.ca/datepickr/demo/).

- Need nice formatted dates after selection? __Do it yourself__.

### Usage

``` html
<div id='datepickr'></div>

<script>
    var el = document.getElementById('datepickr');
    new Datepickr(el, function(res) {
       // console.log(res);
    });
</script>

```

### API

#### `new Datepickr(element, callback, options);`

The callback returns an array of arrayed dates whenever a date is selected.

    [1413950400000,1],
    [1414468800000,1]
